## VARIABLE

##### Variable is a reusable cointainer for storing value, a variable behaves as if it were the value it contains.

## DATA TYPES
##### There are four different types as listed below with samples. Each data type has its own set of properties, methods, and behaviors that allow programmers to manipulate and process data effectively in their programs.



>####INTEGER
This basically represent whole numbers no fraction parts.

age= 21
players= 22

print(f"The average age of players in the match is {age} years old")
print(f"There are {players} players on the pitch")
print(f"There has been just {coaches} coaches in football")
